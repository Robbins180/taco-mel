          <h2>WE USE HIGH QUALITY, SUSTAINABLE INGREDIENTS.</h2>
          <p>For us, it’s not enough to offer affordable, craveable, innovative choices. It also has to be food you feel good about, made with ingredients you can understand. Over the years, we’ve made significant improvements to our food to offer you just that. While we continue to challenge ourselves to push the boundaries further, some of our biggest U.S. milestones so far include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Simplifying our ingredients: We removed artificial flavors and colors and replaced them with natural alternatives, where possible, and we removed artificial trans fat and high fructose corn syrup.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Reducing sodium: We have reduced sodium across the menu by 15 percent, but we’re not stopping there. We’re pushing ourselves to reduce sodium further, for a total of a 25 percent reduction across the menu.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Sourcing sustainable palm oil: We have removed any unsustainable palm oil from our food and are committed to only sourcing sustainable palm oil moving forward.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Sourcing quality proteins: We have been committed to sourcing chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine, and we are working to reduce antibiotics important to human medicine in our beef supply.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Offering better beverages: At least 50% of our medium fountain beverages will be 100 calories and 20 grams of sugar or less. We’re working hard to achieve that goal. Interested in trying one of these better beverages? Try the Mtn Dew Baja Blast Zero Sugar or Pepsi Zero Sugar, in restaurants now.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>WE BELIEVE TRANSPARENCY IS KEY.</h2>
          <p>We’re not big on secrets. That’s why, we always make it easy to learn what’s in your food. We were one of the first quick service restaurants to post full nutrition information and ingredient statements online. Since then, we have incorporated a (V) symbol on our menuboards in restaurants to remove the guesswork for our vegetarian customers and help them locate options that fit their lifestyle. We have also expanded our website to include allergen information and a nutrition calculator to help you find options and customize your own creations to fit your lifestyle and make an informed decision.</p>
