// Taco Mel is a parody website recreating a vintage taco bell menu from 1999 with customized options that will be absolutely free.

The goal will be for the user to customize their order through a multilayer array of options, add it to the checkout bag, proceed to the information and payment page, ( With no initial backend, there will be no saved personal user information or data saved, except for the login/logout Auth info for site security ) and end at an order receipt page with their posted order.

The site will be set up to display an interactive front-end design and functional order menu from start to finish. Mobile-friendly functions will be a future implementation as well as other added features.
